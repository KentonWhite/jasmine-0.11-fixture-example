A trivial example Rails app that demonstrates how controller specs can be used
to generate markup used as fixture within javascript tests.

An [explanation](http://pivotallabs.com/users/jb/blog/articles/1152-javascripttests-bind-reality-) of the technique.

Gems managed with bundler 0.9.11

To generate the fixture, run `spec spec/controllers/js_fixtures_spec.rb`

To run the Jasmine server, run `rake jasmine`

To run the Jasmine specs, hit localhost:8888
